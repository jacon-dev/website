            <h2>Senior Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a senior software engineer working in a self organising agile team of nine engineers with a DevOps mindset, responsible for delivering a core commercial transformation program for finance.
              I work closely with the transformation project team and finance architects to take high-level designs and delivery enterprise level integration solutions for SAP in the finance area.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work closely with the product team to translate product requirements into meaningful solutions, ensuring that we deliver value to the business and our customers.
              I actively participate in all squad ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and personally lead retrospectives to ensure that we are continuously improving our processes and delivering high-quality software and are accountable for our commitments.
              I have actively driven the migration of some of our software solutions from Azure to AWS to help reduce costs and improve performance, security, scalability, reliability and observability.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have also taken the lead on driving an engineering mindset change within the squad, helping to evolve our software development practices, principles, and coding standards.
              I ensure that the team is up to date with the latest technologies and practices, and I encourage a culture of learning and growth.

            <h2>Lead Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
              I’m the technical lead in an agile team of five software engineers and three quality assurance engineers, responsible for working directly with the Product team and Architects to translate product requirements and high-level designs into meaningful solutions. 
              I do this through technical discovery and proof of concept work that allows me outline and refine implementation details for each feature and story. 
              From this I create low level technical design documentation using C4 modelling which I use to support and guide the engineers within the team on the delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              I directly support each engineer with their delivery as needed, coaching through pair programming where necessary and providing code reviews on all work that passes through the team, giving encouragement and constructive feedback where possible. 
              I have also collaborated directly with underperforming individuals to help stabilise their professional careers and help develop the right foundations, both technically and mentally, to foster personal growth and success in their roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              I attend all squad scrum rituals as well as supporting wider tribe ceremonies for cross team and cross functional planning, engaging with other tribes and teams outside of my own where necessary to provide domain expertise as needed. 
              I also work with other lead engineers within the tribe to help continually evolve our software development practices, principals and coding standards and then ensuring I keep the team abreast of any changes. 
              I also champion technical debt within the squad and tribe, actively raising technical debt work where I spot it and driving technical debt work back into the teams to help reduce its impact on our codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work directly with the Service Desk and Incident Management team on high priority incidents when these fall into my domain. 
              I must be responsive and work quickly to help diagnose issues as early as possible, prioritise workloads and then ensure timely testing and delivery of fixes to help restore services. 
              I also developed the first iteration of real time monitoring for our product using New Relic against our tribe’s key performance indicators, giving us a reliable early warning system to potential production incidents both for release windows and day to day.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have driven the migration of our old Java automation framework into .NET, upgraded the framework to .NET 8 and delivered an Azure DevOps build pipeline that integrates with SonarQube for a robust quality gate. 
              I introduced the core functionality to allow us to evaluate frontend functionality using Selenium and migrated the projects BDD framework from SpecFlow to Reqnroll to avoid licensing issues. 
              Alongside this I also spend time every week coaching our quality assurance engineers in .NET fundamentals and best practices by way of coding katas and test-driven development.

              I worked closely with both Product Management and our clients to plan quarterly commitments for my team to deliver, ensuring that expectations were set, and that work was achievable with key performance indicators met consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              I ensured that the team had the autonomy and freedom to deliver work by supporting them through leading the scrum ceremonies and helping them drive changes to ways of working through defining actions off the back of retrospectives and encouraging ownership of improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
              I fostered an open and honest culture in the team and introduced owned 360 feedback to help underpin individual performance and drive personal objectives and growth. 
              I conducted regular one-to-one catch ups with every member of the team to ensure that they were on target for their objectives, had the support from me they needed and equally were pushing themselves to achieve better results each time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I shared squad improvements at a wider tribe and cross functional level to ensure that other areas of our engineering department had opportunities to try new things to improve their processes. 
              I received regular positive feedback from my team and peers for my leadership style, ability to challenge up and foster trust, and for my wider contributions to engineering leadership.

              I was promoted to senior engineer in an agile team comprised of six software engineers and two quality assurance engineers and responsible for working directly with the lead engineer and product owner to translate technical designs and product requirements into resilient and scalable software solutions. 
              I would spend time previewing work coming to the team to understand the technical documentation outlined by the lead engineer and provide accurate sizing of work ready for refinement with the team.

              I actively supported the development of more junior engineers by conducting coding kata sessions to help build their confidence of test-driven development and software engineering fundamentals. 
              I would also spend time pairing with others within the team to help share knowledge and experience as well as bolster my own understanding of both our products and software development in general. I would also contribute regularly to code reviews to help create a cycle of feedback to improve both the software we delivered and my own understanding of best practices.

              I worked as a senior engineer within a team of five software engineers, comprised of both onshore and offshore members. 
              I led internal initiatives to drive improvements to the underlying core framework of a clients key CRM software as well as delivering changes of varying sizes across a three-tier architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
              I provided facilities to both support teams and development projects, both onshore and offshore, for architectural steering, UI design, as well as coding standards, practices, and quality. 
              I would translate client requirements into meaningful technical documentation to then pass to our offshore teams to deliver the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led a key initiative to upgrade our main client’s key CRM application from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.5.2 to improve stability, reliability, security, and performance. 
              This upgrade involved me making widespread improvements to the codebase to remove breaking changes, particularly in .NET 2.0 components embedded in JavaScript. 
              It also allowed me to take massive advantage of threading improvements to remove areas of code that locked the UI making it appear unresponsive.

              I was promoted to technical analyst whilst continuing to work on a second line support team. 
              I began spending more time with the engineering teams and putting focus on delivering change and learning more .NET. 
              I spent time pair programming with contractors and experienced engineers to further develop my understanding of .NET as well as learn fundamental techniques such as test-driven development and SOLID principles. 
              I was eventually recognised as a key contributor to the core framework with my second line role taking a back seat on that basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also involved myself with incident management and became a key member of the international incident management team where I would be the technical single point of contact into I.T. for E.ON wide incidents. 
              I ensured timely technical diagnosis and fix of production wide issues, sometimes globally, and engaging with other support teams or engineering to ensure delivery of the fix as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then took it upon myself to design and deliver a replacement monitoring tool for the incident management team. 
              The old tool, written in WinForms, had hardcoded individual credentials, used inefficient SQL queries and was not very performant. 
              I replaced this with a modern WPF equivalent that was more secure, set across a three-tier architecture and enhanced to allow individual teams to create their own monitoring solutions for day-to-day purposes. 
              I got significant praise from leadership for the introduction of a critical tool that remained in use after I left.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also moved from being the technical single point of contact on the incident management team to being the incident manager. 
              I was responsible for co-ordinating teams across E.ON globally to ensure the timely fix of production incidents. This included onshore support teams, offshore third parties responsible for hardware, as well as internal client stakeholders serving customers. 
              I went on to continue this role in an out of hours capacity due to continued positive feedback on my ability to oversee large scale incidents with confidence.

              I started my I.T. career as a junior technical analyst. I spent my time working on a second line support team with other analysts, investigating second line tickets that were unresolved by our service desk. 
              I would review ticket details, look to replicate problems, and then ultimately diagnose a fix. I would then remotely connect to advisor’s computers and enact the fixes out directly to resolve issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would also infrequently make minor changes to the application codebase using HTML and JavaScript where the change was small enough to remain internal to my team. Where changes were more significant, 
              I would consult with our engineering teams and organise for change to be handed over to them.

              It was in this role I discovered a passion for software engineering, particularly with .NET. 
              I learned C# through self-teaching in my spare time and used this to write a WinForms application that could perform a series of manual fixes remotely in a couple of minutes for one of our field sales applications, saving me thirty minutes of time on tickets with related issues.
